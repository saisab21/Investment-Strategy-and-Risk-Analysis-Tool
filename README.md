# Investment-Strategy-and-Risk-Analysis-Tool


This project is an investment analysis tool made to help users plan their financial goals and check if those goals are achievable based on their current investments. It looks at factors like market data, user risk tolerance, taxes, inflation, and transaction fees. The tool then gives recommendations and visualizes the potential outcomes of the investment strategies.

## How it Works
The tool allows users to input details like their initial investment, financial goal, and timeline. Based on these inputs, it does the following:

Fetches Indian market data for stocks and indices (e.g., NIFTY, SENSEX).
Profiles the userâ€™s risk (based on their age, income stability, and risk tolerance).
Runs simulations (Monte Carlo) to check if the user can achieve their financial goals within the given timeline.
Applies real-world factors like taxes, transaction fees, and inflation to adjust the projections.
Provides actionable recommendations and visualizes the outcomes.
